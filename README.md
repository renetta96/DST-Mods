# Atezaroth The Hollow Walker
This is my first DST Mod, still trying to make more cool stuffs.

General introduction :

- He is a decaying Undead, so sometimes his flesh falls off the body and becomes rot. He gains 15 HP on eating rot.
- He becomes bloodlust when his hunger falls below 50% and 25%, which increases damage and movementspeed. Still considering if he should take more damage at this state.
- He becomes tougher every time comback from death, which means increase damage absorption.
- High max hunger (200), but hunger rate is 1.55 times that of Wilson. Low sanity, deals 30% less damage at normal state.
